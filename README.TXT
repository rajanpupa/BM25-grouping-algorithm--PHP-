This code is written after acquiring the knowledge of document grouping after the smart news aggregation project
done as minor project in our collage. 
The concept is 
    Pass a set/collection of documents(id=>article)
    get scores which determines match scores between the documents
    use that score or normalized score as a basis for grouping the documents , taking threshold according to 
    the nature of document you are sending.
